Java provides several tools for dealing with concurrency. Using these
tools improperly can cause deadlocks and degraded performance, so it’s
important for developers to understand them. This article explains why
each of these tools exist and when to use each one.

## Concurrency is Hard

To understand these constructs, you need to understand the 2 main
difficulties with concurrent programming: memory visibility and
atomicity.

### Memory Visibility

The program below starts a thread that waits for the main thread to set
the `stopRequested{:java}` variable to true.

```java
import java.util.concurrent.TimeUnit;

class Example {

    private static boolean stopRequested = false;

    public static void main(String[] args) throws InterruptedException {
        Thread backgroundThread = new Thread(() -> {
            int i = 0;
            while (!stopRequested) {
                i++;
            }
        });

        backgroundThread.start();
        TimeUnit.SECONDS.sleep(1);
        stopRequested = true;
    }
}
```

If you run it, it probably will not terminate; the background thread
will always think `stopRequested{:java}` is false and continue to loop. Why?
The java memory model does not guarantee that writes on a variable in
one thread will appear in another thread. In other words, memory
modifications are not always **visible** to other threads.

### Atomicity

Consider the program below:

```java
int x = 1;
x++;
```

While `x++{:java}` is one line of code, it is actually several instructions:

1. Load value for x
2. Increment the value by 1
3. Store the new value

Consider 2 threads `a{:java}` and `b{:java}` running this line simultaneously:

1. Thread a loads the current value of x: 1
2. Thread b loads the current value of x: 1
3. Thread a increments the value 2
4. Thread b increments the value 2
5. Thread a stores 2 into x
6. Thread b stores 2 into x

Two increment operations are performed, but the final value is only
incremented by 1, clearly that is wrong. This shows how operations (even
1 liners) can be interleaved in strange ways that result in bugs; they
are not **atomic**.

## Solutions for Concurrency

Concurrent programming is **hard** and that’s why these constructs
exist; they provide guarantees that allow you to better reason about
your programs.

### Volatile

Volatile variables address the memory visibility problem: they tell Java
to always grab the latest value from the memory cache that is shared
between threads. In other words, when a thread writes to a variable, a
thread that later reads the value is guaranteed to see the latest value.
This means volatile variables fix the loop example but not the `x++{:java}`
example.

### Synchronized

Synchronized blocks have stronger semantics than volatile; they address
the memory visibility problem, but they **also address the atomicity problem**
by ensuring only 1 thread is running the synchronized block at a time.
This means synchronized blocks fix both examples above, but they are
less performant than volatile variables due to locking.

### Atomic

Atomic variables have volatile semantics with `get{:java}` and `set{:java}` but also
solve the atomicity problem via compare and set (CAS) operations
(`compareAndSet{:java}` method). Unlike synchronized blocks, they are
non-blocking, resulting in better performance than synchronized blocks
in _most_ cases.

<Info title="What is CAS?">{`
    CAS is a form of non-locking synchronization. It is an atomic instruction
    that checks the current value and only applies the new value if the current
    value equals the expected value. CAS is generally more performant than
    traditional locks because it does not actually lock or reschedule threads on
    the CPU. Like everything else, CAS comes with trade-offs. Designing
    algorithms with CAS is more difficult than using a standard lock. They are
    actually less performant when contention is high, but still faster
    in most real world cases.

## Summary

|              | Changes visible to other threads? | Atomic? | CAS? |
| ------------ | --------------------------------- | ------- | ---- |
| Volatile     | Yes                               | No      | No   |
| Synchronized | Yes                               | Yes     | No   |
| Atomic       | Yes                               | Yes     | Yes  |
