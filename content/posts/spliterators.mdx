<Warning>This is a rough, early draft.</Warning>

Like Iterators, Spliterators let you traverse elements of a data source, but they're easier to implement, and can be converted to streams.
This article introduces Spliterators and their advantages over Iterators.

## What is an Iterator?

Let's walk through iterators first, since that will help with understanding Spliterators.
An iterator is a built-in Java interface with methods for traversing elements of a collection.

- `boolean hasNext(){:java}` returns `true{:java}` if there are more elements to iterate over
- `T next(){:java}` returns the next element in the iteration
- `void remove(){:java}` removes the last element returned by the iterator

Consider this example that prints the elements of a list:

```java
var numbers = List.of(1, 2, 3);
for (int i = 0; i < numbers.size(); i++) {
    System.out.println(numbers.get(i));
}
```

This works, but what if you want to do the same for a `Set{:java}`? Sets do not have a get by index method like a list, so how do you iterate through its elements? Yes, an iterator!

```java
var numbers = Set.of(1, 2, 3);
for (Iterator<Integer> iterator = numbers.iterator(); iterator.hasNext();) {
    int number = iterator.next();
    System.out.println(number);
}
```

Hooray! You can now traverse arbitrary collections using the same lines of code.
But this comes at a cost—the approach is verbose and includes a lot of boilerplate just to iterate over a collection.
The Java language designers must have agreed, because they introduced a simpler alternative: the for-each loop.

```java
var numbers = Set.of(1, 2, 3);
for (int number: numbers) {
    System.out.println(number);
}
```

Yes, the beloved for-each loop is just a nice way of using an iterator.

## How do Spliterators differ from Iterators?

Spliterators and Iterators both allow you traverse through something, but they have some differences. Spliterators:

- Include a few extra methods that allow the Spliterator to be split for parallel operations:
    - `int characteristics(){:java}`
    - `long estimateSize(){:java}`
    - `Spliterator<T> trySplit(){:java}`
- Merge `T next(){:java}` and `boolean hasNext(){:java}` into `boolean tryAdvance(Consumer<? super T> action){:java}`
- Do not have a `E remove(){:java}` method

We will go into more detail on these methods in the next section.

## How do I make a Spliterator?

Let's make a Spliterator for lists. Here's our class with the fields that we need:

```java
public class ListSpliterator<T> implements Spliterator<T> {
    private final List<T> list; // the backing list
    private int current; // the current index, modified on advance/split
    private final int end; // one past the last index

    public ListSpliterator(List<T> list, int start, int end) {
        this.list = list;
        this.current = start;
        this.end = end;
    }

    public ListSpliterator(List<T> list) {
        this(list, 0, list.size());
    }
}
```

Now we implement the most important method `boolean tryAdvance(Consumer<? super T> action){:java}`.
If a remaining element exists, this method performs the given action on it and returns true; otherwise, it returns false.
In my opinion, combining `hasNext{:java}` and `next{:java}` into a single method makes iteration easier to reason about, since all the state is managed in one place.

```java
@Override
public boolean tryAdvance(Consumer<? super T> action) {
    if (current >= end) {
        // We are at the end
        return false;
    }
    // Apply the action to our next element
    action.accept(list.get(current));
    // Increment current for the next call
    current += 1;
    // Return true to let the caller know the action was performed
    return true;
}
```

TODO: trySplit

The next method is `estimateSize{:java}` which returns an estimate of the number of remaining elements.
If the size is infinite, unknown, or too expensive to compute, the method should return `Long.MAX_VALUE{:java}`.
It's pretty straightforward in our example:

```java
@Override
public long estimateSize() {
    return end - current;
}
```

Lastly, the `characteristics{:java}` method returns a set of flags that describe the behavior of the Spliterator.
These flags help the Stream API optimize processing—especially in parallel streams.
You return them as a bitwise OR of constants like `ORDERED{:java}`, `SIZED{:java}`, or `IMMUTABLE{:java}` from the Spliterator interface.
It's important that these characteristics are correct, since incorrect flags can lead to bugs or inefficient stream processing
Here's how that looks in our example:

```java
@Override
public int characteristics() {
    return ORDERED | SIZED | SUBSIZED;
}
```

## How do I create a stream from a Spliterator?

Now that you've created a Spliterator, we can convert it into a Stream to reap the benefits the benefits of Java Streams.
It's quite straightforward using `StreamSupport{:java}`:

```java
List<String> items = List.of("a", "b", "c", "d", "e");
Spliterator<String> spliterator = new ListSpliterator<>(items);
Stream<String> stream = StreamSupport.stream(spliterator, /* parallel */ false);
```
