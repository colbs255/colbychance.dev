A well-structured repository is one of the easiest ways to improve collaboration, onboarding, and maintainability. It tells contributors (and future you) how to use, understand, and work on the project without guesswork.
This post is a quick overview of the files that every serious software project should include. We will start with the obvious ones and then move to the underrated gems.


## The Basics

Let's quickly cover the basic stuff you are probably already familiar with:

**README.md**  
Provides an overview of the project, setup instructions, and usage examples.

**LICENSE**  
Specifies the legal terms under which the project can be used and modified.

**.gitignore**  
Lists files and directories that Git should ignore.

## flake.nix and flake.lock

## .envrc

## justfile

## .editorconfig

## Lint/Style configuration
