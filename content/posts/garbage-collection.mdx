<Warning>This is a rough, early draft.</Warning>

These are my notes taken from Gil Tene's [talk on Java garbage collection](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v#Uj1_4shgXpk).

## Classifying Garbage Collectors

These are the common terms used to classify garbage collectors.
Note that a garbage collector can be a combination of these.

- **Concurrent**  
   Collector performs garbage collection work concurrently with the application's own execution.
- **Parallel**  
   Collector uses multiple CPUs to perform garbage collection work.
- **Stop-the-world**  
   _(Opposite of concurrent)_ Collector performs garbage collection while the application is completely stopped.
- **Monolithic**  
   Collector does all the work in a single indivisible step.
- **Incremental**  
   _(Opposite of monolithic)_ Collector performs work as a series of smaller steps.
- **Mostly**  
   Qualifier used to say something is sometimes not what it is (e.g., _mostly concurrent_ collector).

## Evaluating Garbage Collectors

- **Throughput**  
   How much time is spent doing actual application work vs garbage collection?
- **Latency**  
   How does GC affect individual app operations?
- **Footprint**  
   How much extra memory is needed for the GC?
- **Scalability**  
   How do these metrics change as heap sizes decrease? ZGC for example works well with large heaps (terabytes)

## What do all GCs do?

- Identify live objects in heap
- Reclaim resources held by dead objects
- Periodically relocate live objects

## Garbage Collection Terms

- **Live set**  
   Objects in the heap that are still live (reachable).
- **Safepoint**  
   Point in a thread's execution when the collector can identify all the references in that execution stack.
- **Bringing a thread to a safepoint**  
   Act of getting a thread to reach a safepoint (but not past it).
  Generally done by stopping the thread, but JNI is an exception, since the thread can continue to run while in the safepoint.
- **Global Safepoint**  
   All threads are in a safepoint.
- **Stop-the-world pause**  
   A global safepoint.

## Garbage Collection Types

### Mark/Sweep/Compact Collector

Mark

- Start from roots (thread stacks, static, etc)
- Mark everything you find as live (basically a graph traversal)
- At the end, all reachable objects are marked live and all others are marked dead
- Work is generally **linear to live-set**

Sweep

- Scan the heap and track/free the dead objects
- Scan's the **entire** heap

Compact

- Over time, heap will get "swiss cheesed"
- The free space (holes) might not be large enough to accommodate new allocations (fragmentation)
- Compaction moves live objects together to reclaim contiguous empty space
- Has to fix pointers to ALL objects (when moving an object, all things that point to it also have to update their pointers)
- Work is **linear to the live set** - only the live objects need to be fixed

### Copy Collector

- Heap region is divided into a "from" space and a "to" space, meaning this collector requires 2X max
- Moves all objects from a "from" space to a "to" space and reclaims the "from" space
- Copy root references to "from" space then follow with everything else
- At the end, all live objects are in "to" space and "from" space can be reclaimed
- Work is generally **linear to live set**

### Generational Collector

- **Weak generational hypothesis**: most objects die young.
- Garbage collectors take advantage of the generation hypothesis by splitting the heap into a young and old generation, collecting the young generation more frequently.
- Live set in the young generation is a small percentage of space.
- Promote objects that live long enough to older generations.
- Only collect old generation as they fill up.
- Young generation usually uses a copy collector while old generation uses something like mark/sweep/compact.
- This results in a more efficient collector.

## Java Garbage Collectors

Now that you know some theory for garbage collectors, here are the collectors you can pick from in Java.

### Serial

A single threaded, low footprint collector.

### Parallel

A collector that focuses on throughput.
It stops the world on everything and uses multiple threads to collect.

Characteristics:

- Generational
- Young-gen: monolithic, stop-the-world copying
- Old-gen: Monolithic stop-the-world Mark/sweep/compact

### G1

A collector that focuses on a balance of throughput and latency.

Characteristics:

- Generational
- Young-gen: monolithic, stop-the-world copying
- Splits heap into many regions
- Old-gen: mostly concurrent
    - But also stops the world for compaction (compaction always stops the world)
    - But it is incremental, so we can do this in increments
- Tries to avoid full GC, but sometimes has to do it

### CMS

A collector that also focuses on a balance of throughput and latency, but was replaced by G1.

### ZGC

A collector that focuses on low latency while also scaling to large heaps (multiple terabytes).
While many GCs can pause for hundreds of milliseconds, ZGC pauses for at most 1ms!

Characteristics:

- Generational
- Concurrent
- Constant pause times
- Splits heap into many regions
- Parallel
- Compacting
- Simple to tune

### Epsilon

A collector that does not actually do any garbage collection.
It's very fast since it does not do anything, but your application will run out of memory.
